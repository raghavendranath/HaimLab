Binding of the probes to each Env was measured using a cell-based ELISA system. Data are expressed as percent binding of the antibody to the tested Env relative to its binding to the control AD8 Env. Binding is normalized for the level of cell-surface expression using saturating concentrations of CD4-Ig. Values were log-transformed and corrected by a logistic function.</p>

For each segment we calculated the amino acid length (L), number of PNGS (G), Charge (C) and mean hydropathy score (H). The accession number of each Env and year of isolation are indicated. N/A, Genbank accession number not yet assigned. ND, test not performed.</p>

All Envs were isolated from plasma samples collected before initiation of Maraviroc treatment. For all sequence datasets used to calculate Volatility indices, identical protein sequences were excluded.</p>
